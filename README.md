# IntelliJ IDEA plugin for aiding development of NetBeans IDE plugins

The plugin adds a Run Configuration for NetBeans IDE plugins.
\
It basically just runs nbm-maven-plugin:run-ide and passes the NetBeans installation directory, user directory and VM arguments to it. 

In the future, I hope to add also build hooks to make IntelliJ build the NetBeans clusters.
